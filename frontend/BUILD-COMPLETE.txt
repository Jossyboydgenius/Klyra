=== UNIVERSAL CROSS-CHAIN PAYMENT SYSTEM - BUILD COMPLETE ===

✅ ALL FEATURES BUILT AND READY

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 WHAT YOU HAVE:

1. MAIN PAYMENT SYSTEM (/payment)
   - Send ANY token from ANY chain
   - Recipient receives ANY token on ANY chain
   - Automatic routing & conversion
   - Multi-aggregator comparison (1inch, Socket, LI.FI, Squid)

2. PAYMENT REQUESTS (/request-payment)
   - Create shareable payment links
   - Like Venmo but cross-chain
   - Merchant specifies what they want
   - Customer pays with anything

3. PAYMENT LINKS (/pay/[id])
   - Customers click link
   - Pay with any token they have
   - Automatic conversion to merchant's token

4. TRANSACTION TRACKING
   - Real-time status updates
   - Step-by-step progress
   - Cross-chain bridging status
   - Error handling

📦 INTEGRATIONS:

✅ 1inch Fusion+ (cross-chain)
✅ Across Protocol (fast bridge ~2s, mainnet + testnet)
✅ Socket API (15+ bridges)
✅ LI.FI (20+ protocols)
✅ Squid Router (cross-chain, mainnet + testnet)
✅ Coinbase Wallet (OnchainKit)
✅ Wagmi (wallet management)
✅ Supabase (payment requests DB)

🔑 API KEYS NEEDED:

Add these to your .env.local:

NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_API_KEY=
Get from: https://socket.tech/dashboard

NEXT_PUBLIC_SQUID_INTEGRATOR_ID=
Get from: https://v2.app.squidrouter.com/
Note: This is an INTEGRATOR ID, not an API key
Mainnet/Testnet: Auto-detected from Network Selector!

NEXT_PUBLIC_LIFI_API_KEY= (OPTIONAL - only for higher rate limits)
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIFI_INTEGRATOR_KEY_STRING=klyra (Your app name for tracking)
Get from: https://li.fi/
Note: Works without key! Only add API key for higher rate limits
Integrator string is just your app name, not an API key

NEXT_PUBLIC_ACROSS_INTEGRATOR_ID=0xdead (2-byte hex string)
Get from: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-HY6mzTeGZs91HxObkQmwkMQuH7oy8ngZ1ROiu-f4SR4oMw/viewform
Note: Fastest bridge (~2s fills on mainnet, ~1min on testnet)
Mainnet/Testnet: Auto-detected from Network Selector!

NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY= (already have)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONEINCH_API_KEY= (already have)

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=

🗄️ DATABASE SETUP:

Run this SQL in Supabase:

CREATE TABLE payment_requests (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  merchant_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  merchant_address TEXT NOT NULL,
  chain_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  token_address TEXT NOT NULL,
  token_symbol TEXT NOT NULL,
  token_decimals INTEGER NOT NULL,
  amount TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  paid_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  paid_by TEXT,
  transaction_hash TEXT
);

CREATE INDEX idx_payment_requests_merchant ON payment_requests(merchant_address);
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_requests_status ON payment_requests(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_requests_created_at ON payment_requests(created_at DESC);

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚀 QUICK START:

1. Add API keys to .env.local
2. Setup Supabase database (run SQL above)
3. npm run dev
4. Visit http://localhost:3000/payment
5. Connect wallet
6. Try sending a payment!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 USAGE EXAMPLES:

EXAMPLE 1: Direct Payment
→ Go to /payment
→ You have: USDC on Polygon
→ Send to: 0xRecipient
→ They get: ETH on Ethereum
→ System handles everything!

EXAMPLE 2: Payment Request
→ Merchant: "I want 100 USDC on Base"
→ Creates request → Gets link
→ Customer: Clicks link, pays with DAI on Arbitrum
→ Merchant receives exactly 100 USDC on Base

EXAMPLE 3: Shopping
→ Store shows: "Pay 0.5 ETH on Ethereum"
→ You only have MATIC on Polygon
→ Click pay link
→ Pay with MATIC
→ Store receives 0.5 ETH on Ethereum

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
